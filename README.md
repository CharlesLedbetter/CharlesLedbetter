- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CharlesLedbetter
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in API development and design and UI development.



I have always had a passion for technology and technical problem solving. As a software engineer I am fortunate enough 
to be able to focus on both of those passions on a daily basis. In my previous career in live event production I had 
the opportunity to hone my problem solving skills through the unique and technically challenging problems that my 
team and I would often have to deal with in an ad hoc manner. As a software engineer I have developed an appreciation 
for preemptivly solving technical problems through a focus on clean code, software development best practices, and 
agile planning.
